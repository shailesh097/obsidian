- In Go’s servemux, longer URL patterns always take precedence over shorter ones. So, if a servemux contains multiple patterns which match a request, it will always dispatch the request to the handler corresponding to the longest pattern. This has the nice side-effect that you can register patterns in any order and it won’t change how the servemux behaves.

- Request URL paths are automatically sanitized. If the request path contains any . or ..
  elements or repeated slashes, the user will automatically be redirected to an equivalent clean URL. For example, if a user makes a request to `/foo/bar/..//baz` they will automatically be sent a `301 Permanent Redirect` to `/foo/baz` instead.

- If a subtree path has been registered and a request is received for that subtree path without a trailing slash, then the user will automatically be sent a `301 Permanent Redirect` to the subtree path with the slash added. For example, if you have registered the subtree path `/foo/` , then any request to `/foo` will be redirected to `/foo/`.
