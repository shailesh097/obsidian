##### 1.1 Fixed Path
Go’s servemux supports two different types of URL patterns: fixed paths and subtree paths. Our two new patterns — `/snippet/view` and `/snippet/create` — are both examples of fixed paths. In Go’s servemux, fixed path patterns like these are only matched (and the corresponding handler called) when the request URL path exactly matches the fixed path.

##### 1.2 Subtree Path
In contrast, our pattern `/` is an example of a subtree path (because it ends in a trailing
slash). Another example would be something like `/static/`. If it helps your understanding, you can think of subtree paths as acting a bit like they have a wildcard at the end, like `/**` or `/static/**` . This helps explain why the `/` pattern is acting like a catch-all. The pattern essentially means match a single slash, followed by anything (or nothing at all).
