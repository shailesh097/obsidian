1. Start with ‘master’ for stable code.
2. Create a ‘develop’ branch for ongoing development.
3. Use feature branches (e.g., ’feature/xyz’) for isolated changes.
4. When ready for release, branch off ’develop’ to a release branch (e.g., ‘release/v1.0‘), perform final fixes, then merge into ‘main‘ and tag the release.
5. For urgent fixes, use ‘hotfix‘ branches off of ‘main‘ and merge back into both ‘main‘ and ‘develop‘.
