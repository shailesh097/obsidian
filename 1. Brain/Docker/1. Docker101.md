##### Docker Images vs Docker Container
-  **Docker Image** is immutable template or blueprint used to create *docker container*. It is built using *Dockerfile* . It can be stored and shared via Docker Hub.

- **Docker Container** is a mutable running instance of a *Docker Image*. It has a *unique ID* and can have *state* (such as running processes). Multiple containers can be created from the same image.
