##### 1.1 Installing and running 
- Install with `sudo dnf install golang` in fedora.
- create a file with \*.go
- to run the program `go run <filename.go>`
- to build the binary `go build <filename.go>`

Basic *main* function structure:
```Go
package main
import "fmt"

func main(){
	fmt.Println("Hello World!")
}
```

First things to know about go programming language: 
- The structure of a Go project consists of `modules` and `packages`. A `package` is the collection of all the go files in the project. And collection of these packages is called `modules`.

A project can be built with the command.
`go mod init <project-name>`

The above command will initialize a `go.mod` file which contains all the details of the project dependencies along with their version number.

```Go structure
yourproject/
│── go.mod
│── main.go        (package main)
│── mathutils/     (package mathutils)
│   ├── mathutils.go
│   ├── numbers.go
│── stringutils/   (package stringutils)
│   ├── strings.go
```
