 Channels in Go are one of its most powerful featuresâ€”they enable **communication between goroutines**, making concurrent programming much more manageable.


A **channel** is a typed conduit through which you can send and receive values with the **channel operator** `<-`.

Think of a channel as a pipe: one goroutine puts data in one end, and another goroutine takes it out on the other end.

Things to understand about channels:
- **Hold Data:** A channel can hold any type of data(ex. `int`, `slice`, `string` etc.).
- **Thread Safe:** It refers to code, data structures, or operations that can be safely executed by multiple threads (or goroutines, in Go's case) at the same time without causing race conditions or data corruption. When something is **thread-safe**, it means you don't have to worry about threads (or goroutines) stepping on each other while they access shared data. The code is designed in such a way that it handles concurrent access correctly.
- **Listen for Data:** We can listen when a data is added or removed from a channel. We can block code execution until one of it happens.


 ##### 13.1 Declaration and Use:
 ```Go
 package main

func main(){
	var c = make(chan int)
	go process(c)
	for i := range c {
		fmt.Println(i)	
	}
{

func process(c chan int){
	defer close(c)
	for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
		c <- i	
	}
}
```

`defer` means, do the stuff right before the function exits. Here, `close(c)` function will be executed right before the function exits.


```Go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math/rand"
	"time"
)

var (
	MAX_CHICKEN_PRICE float32 = 5
	MAX_TOFU_PRICE    float32 = 3
)

func main() {
	chickenChannel := make(chan string)
	tofuChannel := make(chan string)
	websites := []string{"wallmart.com", "costco.com", "wholefoods.com"}
	for i := range websites {
		go checkChickenPrices(websites[i], chickenChannel)
		go checkTofuPrices(websites[i], tofuChannel)
	}
	sendMessage(chickenChannel, tofuChannel)
}

func checkTofuPrices(website string, c chan string) {
	for {
		time.Sleep(time.Second * 1)
		tofu_price := rand.Float32() * 20
		if tofu_price < MAX_TOFU_PRICE {
			c <- website
		}
	}
}

func checkChickenPrices(website string, chickenChannel chan string) {
	for {
		time.Sleep(time.Second * 1)
		chickenPrice := rand.Float32() * 20
		if chickenPrice <= MAX_CHICKEN_PRICE {
			chickenChannel <- website
			break
		}
	}
}

func sendMessage(chickenChannel chan string, tofuChannel chan string) {
	select {
	case website := <-chickenChannel:
		fmt.Printf("\nText Sent: Found a deal on chicken at %s", website)
	case website := <-tofuChannel:
		fmt.Printf("\nEmail Sent: Found deal on tofu at %v", website)
	}
}
```
