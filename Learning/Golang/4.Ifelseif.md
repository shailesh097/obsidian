```Go
  if a := 2; a > 0 {
    fmt.Printf("%d is positive number.", a)
  } else if a == 0 {
    fmt.Printf("%d is 0.", a)
  } else {
    fmt.Printf("%d is negative number.", a)
  }
```

Any variables declared in a statement are available in current and subsequent branches. Parenthesis are not required around conditionals but braces are required.
