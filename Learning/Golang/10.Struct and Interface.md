### 10.1 Struct
A `struct` in Go is a composite data type that groups together *fields* of different types. First, we can think of structs as a way of defining your own type. So, to create a struct we can use a `type` keyword. 

```Go
package main

type gasEngine struct{
	mpg uint8 // a field
	gallons uint8 // a field	
}

func (e gasEngine) milesLeft() uint8 { // assigned gasEngine struct to this function
	return e.gallons*e.mpg // mpg x gallons = miles left
}

func canMakeIt(e gasEngine, miles uint8){
	if miles <= e.milesLeft(){
		fmt.Println("You can make it there.")
	} else {
		fmt.Println("You cannot make it there. Fill up fuel first.")
	}
}

func main(){
	var myEngine gasEngine = gasEngine{32, 3}	
	var myElecEngine electricEngine = electricEngine{10, 4}
	fmt.Println(myEngine.mpg, myEngine.gallons) // output: 32 12
	myEngine.mpg = 20
	fmt.Println(myEngine) // output: {20, 12}

	// we can use the milesLeft() function to access gasEngine struct variables
	milesToDrive := myEngine.milesLeft()
	fmt.Printf("Total miles left in the tank: %v miles.", milesToDrive) // output: Total miles left in the tank: 128 miles.

	canMakeIt(myEngine, 96) // this funciton will let us know if we can reach to out destination with current amount of fuel.
}
```

In the above example, we have a `gasEngine` as `struct` with `mpg` and `gallons` as fields. We then create a `milesLeft()` function implementing `gasEngine` struct to mimic the inheritance in object oriented programming. We then create a `canMakeIt` function which prints out if we can reach our destination or not my passing the *engine-type* and *miles* to travel as parameters. This is only viable for `gasEngine` cars. If we had another car which is an electric car we are not able to calculate the `canMakeIt()` method for that car. To handle this `interface` is used.

### 10.2 Interface
An interface allows different *types* to be used *interchangeably* if they implement the required method mentioned in the interface. In the above code, let’s have another engine which is electrical. To calculate the `canMakeIt()` method for that electrical engine we define an interface type which includes `milesLeft() uint8` method.

```Go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

type engine interface{
	milesLeft() uint8
}

type gasEngine struct{
	mpg uint8
	gallons uint8
}

type electricEngine struct {
	mpkw uint8
	kwh uint8
}

func (e electricEngine) milesLeft() uint8 {
	return e.mpkw*e.kwh
}

func (e gasEngine) milesLeft() uint8 {
	return e.gallons*e.mpg
}

func canMakeIt(e engine, miles uint8) {
	if miles <= e.milesLeft(){
		fmt.Println("You can make it there.")
	} else {
		fmt.Println("You cannot make it there. Fill up fuel first.")
	}
}

func main() {
	var myEngine gasEngine = gasEngine{32, 3}	
	var myElecEngine electricEngine = electricEngine{10, 4}

	canMakeIt(myEngine, 96) // op: You can make it there.
	canMakeIt(myElecEngine, 60) // op: You cannot make it there.
}
```

Here, we can use *interface* name in `canMakeIt()` function—in this case `engine`—as a parameter. That `interface` parameter can be used in the function `canMakeIt()` if the `struct` has `milesLeft()` method present.
