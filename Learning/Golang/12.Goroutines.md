**Concurrency ≠ Parallelism**

*Concurrency* is when one program is waiting for *task1* to finish it does other tasks and once it gets a return value it returns to *task1* again.

However, in *Parallel Execution* each task is assigned to different CPU cores which concurrently runs multiple tasks in different cores.

##### 12.1 Waitgroup
Use `go` keyword in front of the function that needs to be run concurrently. However, running the function with `go` keyword runs the program and exits the program although the go routines have not finished executing. Therefore, we need a way for our program to wait until these tasks have been complete before exiting the program. To solve this issue the `sync` package can be used which comes installed with go.

```Go
package main
import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
	"sync"
)

var wg = sync.WaitGroup{}
var dbData = []string{"id1", "id2", "id3", "id4", "id5"}
var results = []string{}

func main() {
	t0 := time.Now()
	for  i := range dbData{
		wg.Add(1) // increment counter
		go dbCall(i)	
	}
	wg.Wait() // wait for the counter to be 0
	fmt.Printf("\nTotal execution time: %v", time.Since(t0))
	fmt.Printf("\nThe results are: %v", results)
}

func dbCall(i int){
	var delay float32 = 2000
	time.Sleep(time.Duration(delay)*time.Millisecond)
	fmt.Println("The result from the datatbase is:", dbData[i])
	results = append(resutls, dbData[i])
	defer wg.Done() // decrement counter
}
```

In the above code, while appending the results in `dbData` in `dbCall()` function. When, multiple go routines are accessing and modifying the same memory location we may get corrupt data.

##### 12.2 Mutex
To overcome this issue, we use `Mutex` which makes it safe to modify the array with multiple go routines. The *Mutual exclusion* or `Mutex` ensures that only one goroutine(or thread) accesses a shared resource at a time, to avoid conflicts and bugs.

```Go
package main
import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
	"sync"
)

var m = sync.Mutex{}
var wg = sync.WaitGroup{}
var dbData = []string{"id1", "id2", "id3", "id4", "id5"}
var results = []string{}

func main() {
	t0 := time.Now()
	for  i := range dbData{
		wg.Add(1) // increment counter
		go dbCall(i)	
	}
	wg.Wait() // wait for the counter to be 0
	fmt.Printf("\nTotal execution time: %v", time.Since(t0))
	fmt.Printf("\nThe results are: %v", results)
}

func dbCall(i int){
	var delay float32 = 2000
	time.Sleep(time.Duration(delay)*time.Millisecond)
	fmt.Println("The result from the datatbase is:", dbData[i])
	m.Lock() // check if a lock is already set if yes wait, if no lock
	results = append(resutls, dbData[i])
	m.Unlock() // unlock
	defer wg.Done() // decrement counter
}
```

`m.Lock()` method checks if a lock is already been set by another goroutine; if it has then it will wait there until the lock is released and set the lock itself. `m.Unlock()` unlocks the lock.

Therefore, the the placement of `Lock()` and `Unlock()` methods is crucial. If `Lock()` method is used before `time.Sleep()` then it will destroy the concurrency of the function call.

##### 12.3 ReadWriteMutex
One major disadvantage of `Mutex` is, it doesn’t let other goroutines to access the locked code. To overcome this issue, we can use `RWMutex{}`. It has all the functionalities of `Mutex` with additional `RLock()` and `RUnlock()` methods. 

```Go
package main

import(
	"fmt"
	"time"
	"sync"
)

var m = sync.RWMutex{}
var wg = sync.WaitGroup{}
var dbData = []string{"id1", "id2", "id3", "id4", "id5"}
var results = []string{}

func main() {
	t0 := time.Now()
	for i := range dbData{
		wg.Add(1) // increment counter
		go dbCall(i)
	}
	wg.Wait() // wait for counter to be 0 
	fmt.Printf("\nTotal execution time: %v", time.Since(t0))
	fmt.Printf("\nThe results are %v", results)
}

func dbCall(i int) {
	var delay float32 = 2000
	time.Sleep(time.Duration(delay)*time.Millisecond)
	save(dbData[i])
	log()
	defer wg.Done() //decrement counter
}

func save(result string){
	m.Lock() //
	results = append(results, result)
	m.Unlock()
}

func log(){
	m.RLock()
	fmt.Printf("\nThe current results are: %v", results)
	m.RUnlock()
}
```

When a goroutine reaches the line `m.RLock()` it checks if there is a full lock in the mutex. Full lock is basically just `Lock()` function. If full lock exists the go routine will wait for it to be unlocked. If not, then the goroutine will acquire a read lock then proceed with the rest of the code. Many goroutines may hold readlocks at the same time. These `RLock()` functions will block code execution up in the `Lock()` function. When goroutine hits the line `m.Lock()` all locks must be released which includes `Lock()` and `RLock()`. This prevents us from accessing the `results` *slice* while other goroutines are writing to or reading from the *slice*.

In conclusion, this pattern allows multiple goroutines to read from the slice at the same time only blocking when writes may be potentially happening. In regular `Mutex`, the read and write can happen only once at a time. In contrast, `RWMutex` multiple reads can happen if nothing is being written to the memory.
