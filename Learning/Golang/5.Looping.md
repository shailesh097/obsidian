### 5.1 For Loop

There are different types of for looping technique in Go. 

1. Most basic looping technique(also can used as a while loop):
```Go
  k := 1
  for k < 2 {
    fmt.Println(k)
    k++
  }
```

2. Classic initialization/condition/post technique:
```Go
  for i := 0; i < 3; i++ {
    fmt.Println(i)
  }
```

3. Do a task *n* times:
```Go
  for j := range 4 {
    fmt.Println(j)
  }
```

4. `for` without condition will run indefinitely until stopped with `break` or `return` from the enclosing function:
```Go
  for {
    fmt.Println("Looping")
    break
  }
```

5. We can also continue to the next iteration of the loop with `continue`:
```Go
  for n := range 6 {
    if n%2 == 0 {
      continue
    }
    fmt.Println(n)
  }
```
