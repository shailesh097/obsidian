### 6.1 Array
The four main points to remember for array is:
- Fixed Length
- Same Type
- Indexable
- Contiguous in Memory

**1. Declaration**
 ```Go
 func main() {
	var intArr [3]int32  
	fmt.Println(intArr)
 }
 // output: [0, 0, 0]
```
 The above code shows that array with variable name `intArr` with fixed length of 3 has all of it’s contents as `int32`.

**2. Indexing**
The array in Go can be indexed with following ways:
- `intArr` &rarr; [0, 0, 0]
- `intArr[0]` &rarr; 0
- `intArr[0:3]` &rarr; [0, 0], Here `0` is inclusive and `3` is exclusive. 
- `intArr[1] = 20` &rarr; [0, 20, 0], Value of an item in an array can be changed.

**3. Contiguous in Memory**
The contents of an array is stored in continuous memory locations.
```Go
func main() {
	var intArr [3]int32 = [3]int32{2, 4, 5}
	fmt.Println("The memory address of the arrary is", &intArr[0]) //& prints out the memory location of that variable.
	fmt.Println("The memory address of the arrary is", &intArr[1])
	fmt.Println("The memory address of the arrary is", &intArr[2])
}
// output: 
//The memory address of the arrary is 0xc000184040 (each location is 1 byte)
//The memory address of the arrary is 0xc000184044
//The memory address of the arrary is 0xc000184048
```

In the above code, the array `int32` can store 4 bytes of data. So, the array of size `3` will allocate 12 bytes of contiguous memory. Which means that the first value of the array is stored in first 4 bytes, second value in the second 4 bytes and so on. 

The compiler doesn’t need to store memory location for each element. Just, storing the first element’s memory location is enough. The memory location of the second value in that array can be retrieved by adding 1 to the first memory address. Therefore, to retrieve the position of n<sup>th</sup> element, we can add n to the first memory address.
